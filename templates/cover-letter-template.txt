Use the following guidelines to create a cover letter based on 1: the job posting below and 2: the resume "Resume.pdf" (who corresponds to the applicant). Do not use sentence structures that use '—'.
Intro: "Dear Hiring Manager,"
First paragraph: A description of who the applicant is (positions or experiences related to the job, don't mention the university), what makes them personable (what they like or believe in) and what they want (learning or working on specific topics). Try keeping it to two sentences.
Second paragraph: 3 skills that matter for the position. For each skill, explain how you use that skill, give an example of that usage and explain why it was useful in that example. Try keeping it to three sentences; don't enumerate the skills.
Third paragraph: Pick 2 aspects of the company relevant to the applicant and explain why the applicant would be interested to work at this company. Try keeping it to two sentences; don't enumerate the aspects.
For the last paragraph, use the following format:
"I am confident that my experience aligns with [COMPANY]’s needs and hope to further discuss how I can contribute to your team’s success.

Thank you,
[Full Name]"
